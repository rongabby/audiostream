# 🚨 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX - URGENT

## ❌ **Build Failed Because:**
The error `ConfigError: The expected package.json path: /vercel/path0/package.json does not exist` means Vercel is looking in the wrong directory.

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Choose One Option**

### **Option 1: Fix Current Deployment (Recommended)**
1. 🔧 **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. 🎯 **Find your audiostream project**
3. ⚙️ **Go to Settings → General**
4. 📁 **Set Root Directory to**: `audio-playback-stream`
5. 🚀 **Redeploy from Deployments tab**

### **Option 2: Delete and Re-import (Alternative)**
1. 🗑️ **Delete the current project** in Vercel
2. ➕ **Import again** from https://vercel.com/new
3. 📁 **Set Root Directory to**: `audio-playback-stream` during import
4. 🚀 **Deploy**

## 🔧 **I've Already Fixed:**
- ✅ Added root `package.json` to help Vercel understand the structure
- ✅ Updated `vercel.json` with correct paths
- ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub
- ✅ Updated deployment guide

## 🎯 **Correct Settings for Vercel:**
```
Framework: Other
Root Directory: audio-playback-stream
Build Command: npx expo export --platform web
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
```

## 🚀 **After You Fix the Root Directory:**
The deployment should work perfectly because:
- ✅ All configuration files are ready
- ✅ Build commands are correct
- ✅ Dependencies are properly set up

**The fix is simple - just set the correct root directory in Vercel!**
